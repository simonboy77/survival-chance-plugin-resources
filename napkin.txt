IMPORTANT
- There is a chance to miss, this doesnt affect the chance to still hit a zero after a succesful accuracy roll
- When calculating more than 1 hit ahead, there is a chance that the player will hit ring of life range before all hits
- DONE Should the phoenix necklace also be included? YES
- PVP and multi-combat
- Protection prayers
- Poison/Venom
- DONE Stat drops/level ups in defence or magic
- DONE Player equipment
- DONE HP Change up/down
- DONE HP Level up
- Attack style change (block gives +defence, controlled gives +1 defence)
- Prayer change (protection or magic/defence buff)
- show lowest hp possible?
- Follow the attack speed of the monster with the highest max hit when attacked by
mulitple monsters

Just calculating how likely every hit is to happen will not give correct results of when the player will survive/trigger/die.
Because when you are calculating 4 hits ahead, but after 2 hits the RoL triggers (or the player dies), all possibilities 
after those 2 hits never happen, thus taking those into account is incorrect.

Optimization option: Check if curHit + (maxHit * remainingHits) == SURVIVAL, then we don't need to
go through all options. Just add however many hit options could happen from the current hit to the
SURVIVAL chance and move on to the next hit

For multiple opponents make an array with min- and maxDamage pairs that indicate the hits that are gonna take place
ie: two enemies, A hits 8 with speed 2.4s, B hits 5 with speed 3.6s.
in 10 seconds:
A hits at most ceil(10 / 2.4) = 5 -> at 0.0s 2.4s 4.8s 7.2s 9.6s
B hits at most ceil(10 / 3.6) = 3 -> at 0.0s 3.6s 7.2s

so the min-maxDamage array will look as follows:
{
    0, 8 // A hit 1 at 0.0s
    0, 5 // B hit 1 at 0.0s
    0, 8 // A hit 2 at 2.4s
    0, 5 // B hit 2 at 3.6s
    0, 8 // A hit 3 at 4.8s
    0, 8 // A hit 4 at 7.2s
    0, 5 // B hit 3 at 7.2s
    0, 8 // A hit 5 at 9.6s
}



TESTING on jail guard (8 hits):
from 33hp
stable: safety: 99.99847412109375, escape: 0.00152587890625, die: 0.0, totalHits: 65536.0, iterations: 87380
new:    safety: 99.99847412109375, escape: 0.00152587890625, die: 0.0, totalHits: 65536.0, iterations: 8

Check dps calculator plugin to see how they collect weapon stats

Special monsters:
- Verac, Dharok
- Zulrah (phases)





maxHp = 99
rolTriggerHp = floor(maxHp / 10)



if
currentHp - maxHit < 10
			20


2-29
trigger, not trigger, kill



0 / 1 / 2

currentHp = 2 hp
1/3 die
1/3 trigger
1/3 nothing

what is the % chance i die in the next X amount of hits


if(maxHit < 10){
	return false;
}
